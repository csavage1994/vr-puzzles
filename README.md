This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This was a day and a half project with the focus being on getting an app up and running
in a small amount of time

## Structure:

###The repository consist of

+ Basic html layout
+ Express server files
+ jQuery app to manage A-frame


Install:

The project relies on npm for managing external libraries and dependencies, so be sure to first:

`npm install`

to run it, simply run

`node server.js`

in the root directory.
